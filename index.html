                    <p>The first thing you learn is sacrifice and how to keep moving forward in life, helping your parents to put food on the table. You learn to fight with your work. Then you start to learn values.</p>

                    <p>You learn to fight with your work. Then you start to learn values. That's why, every time I pull on the Argentina shirt or any other, I think about the things that happened to me when I was a kid.</p>
